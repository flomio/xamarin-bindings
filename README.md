# Xamarin Bindings

An example Visual Studio Solution which shows how to bind [Flomio's iOS SDK](https://github.com/flomio/flomio-sdk-ios) to Xamarin and use in an iOS app. 

## Adding to new project

### Add FlomioSDKBindings project to your Solution

### Add reference to bindings project.

Drag the bindings project to the References folder in your project to create a reference.

### Disable Bitcode

Open the .csproj for your iOS application in a text editor of your choice (i.e. using right click > Open with TextEdit), search for the PropertyGroup for the release configuration that you need to turn off bit code for, i.e.:

`<PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|iPhone' ">`

Within that group, see if a MtouchEnableBitcode already exists and edit it, otherwise add:

`<MtouchEnableBitcode>false</MtouchEnableBitcode>`

## Use in new project

See ViewController.cs as a reference on how to configure, inialize the SDK and respond to reader events.
